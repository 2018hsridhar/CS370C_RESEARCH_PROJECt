Based on discussion with Billy Swartworth

1. Yes, I am assuming that we have 3D-model data ( from the point cloud ). The question of how to convert a 2D image to a point cloud does not need to be addressed
2. I am assuming that an IDEAL , but not ACCURATe, alignment is provided by the user. That is, we already have a good idea about how the two pieces/meshes are supposed to fit ... we just don't have a good idea how to fill in the remaining space.
3. What assumptiosn can I make about my input mesh data/3D models? I will most likely assume they are the same size and in the form of point-clouds
4. What is the idea of letting R be both a "Rotation" and "Reflection" matrix? I'm not sure if this too is also critical
5.
